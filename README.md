This repository optimizes linear problems with the simplex method.

Algebraic Simplex Usage: `python3 simplex.py [filename]`, where [filename] is algebraic/p2.txt, algebraic/p3.txt, etc.
Tableaux Simplex Usage: `python3 tableaux.py [filename]`, where [filename] is t2.txt, t3.txt, etc.

Work on each problem is contained in their respective files.
Subproblems are indicated by a - in the filename, ie t3-1.txt is part one of t3, and the standard solution to t3 is contained inside t3.txt
